Hello everybody!

This script automatizes the process of statistic calculation. It's useful for systems engineering students that are taking an Statistics I course.

With this script you can calculate the following:
* Measure of Central tendency (Arithmetic mean, Mode, Median, Geometric mean, Harmonic median to be added in the future)
* Measure of Dispersion tendency (Coefficient of variation, Variance, Quartile Deviation, Inter-quartile Deviation, Median Deviation, Standard Deviation)
* Pearson's correlation coefficient.
* Kurtosis.
* Bowley's coefficient of Skewness.
